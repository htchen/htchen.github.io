Title: Application of graphic cards in computational physics

Abstract: Recently, the graphic processing unit (GPU) has emerged as
an important tool for scientific computing. In some cases, a GPU can
speed up the computation by 10x to 100x, compared to a traditional
CPU.  In this talk, I will briefly introduce the computation model of
the latest generation of GPU, and discuss its applications in
computational physics. In particular, I will use our recent work on
tensor networks as an example, to discuss some generic problems
involved in GPU computing.
