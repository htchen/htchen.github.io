		[2007/12/26] <br />
		The term paper is due on January 6, 2008. Each of you needs to write a report 
		of 500-750 words in English and email it (in .txt, .doc, or .pdf format) to the 
		instructor by the due date. The report should consist 
		of two parts: In the first part you have to summarize the talk you enjoy most, 
		explain why you like it, and describe what you learn from it. In the second part 
		you may write down your opinions about this semester's seminar series, and make 
		some suggestions for future seminars, such as prospective topics or speakers.

        3) Summary of the article; 4) How the observations described in the article relate to your situation, 
        or how the technologies described in the article relate to your research; 5) Your opportunities in information technology suggested
        in the article, or how to improve your prospects.
