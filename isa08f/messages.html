<b>[2008-12-10]</b> Today's seminar is scheduled for Prof. Peter Chen's talk, which will begin at 13:10 in B02 EECS building.
<br />
<br />
<b>[2008-09-24]</b> Everyone has to give a one-minute single-slide presentation in English next Wednesday.
Pleas email the ppt file of your presentation slide to TA Tony (g9765537 [at] oz.nthu.edu.tw) by
Oct 1.<br />
The slide should contain i) your name and any picture of you, ii) your background and interests, and iii) your motivation
and expectation of studying ISA. <br />
We will collect all the presentation slides and send them to each of you, so you may get to know your classmates better.
