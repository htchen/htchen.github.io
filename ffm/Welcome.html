<b>Abstract</b>
</dt>
<dd>
	We describe an empirical study on the feature space of inter-
est points for natural images. Although local features have
been widely used in image analysis as building blocks of var-
ious algorithms, there is still a lack of study on the space of
local features, in particular the distributions of local features
extracted from the locations of interest points. Based on an
approximate neighborhood probing scheme, we devise an ef-
Ô¨Åcient representation that is not only helpful in visualizing the
distributions of local features, but also effective in modeling
the neighborhood structures of local features for fast match-
ing. We present various experimental results that provide use-
ful insights into feature description and fast image matching.
