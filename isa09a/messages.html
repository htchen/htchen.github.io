Each of you will need to give a <b>six-minute</b> presentation in English (mixing with a little Chinese is acceptable).
In your presentation, you may introduce yourself first, and then present the assigned topic.
<br />
About the presentation topics, please go to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/agenda/">TechCrunch 50</a> website.
In its agenda page, you will find the session and the respective company to which you are assigned.
The assigned company is the subject for your presentation, and you need to
introduce the innovation, the product or service, and the technology of that company.
